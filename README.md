# DataAnalysis-Udacity-Nanodegree

This repository contains solutions for Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree.

<b> Project-1:  
Weather Trends </b>

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends from where I live to overall global temperature trends.

<b> Project-2:  
Investigating a Dataset : TMDB Movie Dataset </b>

In this project, I go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.  
It contains following steps
- Data Wrangling 
- Asking Questions.
- Exploring
- Conclusion

<b> Project-3:  
Analyze A/B Test Results </b>

In this project, I try to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

<b> Project-4:  
Wrangle and Analyze Data : WeRateDogs Dataset</b>

In this project, my goal was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.
And My tasks for this project was as follow:

- Data wrangling, which consists of:  
    1) Gathering data  
    2) Assessing data  
    3) Cleaning data  
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data  
- Reporting on  
    1) Data wrangling efforts  
    2) Data analyses and visualizations  
    

<b> Project-5:  
Communicate Data Findings: Ford GoBike System Dataset </b>

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore Ford GoBike System dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings was through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
