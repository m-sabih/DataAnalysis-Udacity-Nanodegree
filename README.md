# DataAnalysis-Udacity-Nanodegree

This repository contains solutions for Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree.

<b> Project-1:  
Weather Trends </b>

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends from where I live to overall global temperature trends.

<b> Project-2:  
Investigating a Dataset : TMDB Movie Dataset </b>

In this project, I carried out the data analysis process and observed how everything fits together.  
It contains following steps:  
- Data Wrangling 
- Asking Questions.
- Exploring
- Conclusion

<b> Project-3:  
Analyze A/B Test Results </b>

In this project, I tried to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company had developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who ‘convert’; i.e. the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

<b> Project-4:  
Wrangle and Analyze Data : WeRateDogs Dataset</b>

In this project, my goal was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. My tasks for this project are as follows:  

- Data wrangling, which consists of:  
    1) Gathering data  
    2) Assessing data  
    3) Cleaning data  
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data  
- Reporting on  
    1) Data wrangling efforts  
    2) Data analyses and visualizations  
    

<b> Project-5:  
Communicate Data Findings: Ford GoBike System Dataset </b>

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore Ford GoBike System dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrated interesting properties, trends, and relationships that were discovered in the selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings was through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
