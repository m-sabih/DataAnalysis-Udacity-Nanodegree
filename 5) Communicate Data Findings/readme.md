# FordGoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset

This document explores https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data dataset. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system. Multiple data files will be joined together as we desire a full year's coverage. This dataset is comprised of approximately 2,506,983 bike rides from year 2019.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the frequency of rides being booked are mostly from the subscribers but duration time of customer is far more than the those who are subscribers, the reason for that might be that subscribers use it for daily commute and the customers use it for long trips that is why they don't use it often but when they do they do it for long duration. Another finding is that the most of the rides are in summer season and at a time when people have holidays and not much in the winter season. By exploration, I also found about the most popular stations and not so popular stations from which start and end their ride.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, first I focused on the of duration for average trip time. Then about the different monthly trends that we found in our dataset such that which month witnessed the most duration etc. Then I analyze different type of user's and type of effect they have on the data. and in the end I discussed about the popularity of different stations.
